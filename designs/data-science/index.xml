      <description>Project Overview In this project, data science techniques were applied to optimize the maintenance planning for a transportation company&amp;rsquo;s truck fleet, specifically focusing on the air system.
Approach
1.Data Analysis and Preprocessing:
The data related to truck air system maintenance was analyzed and preprocessed. This included handling encoded columns and missing data to ensure the dataset was clean and suitable for modeling.
2.Model Training and Evaluation:
Various machine learning models were used to predict air system failures, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Naive Bayes.</description>
